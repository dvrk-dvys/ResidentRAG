Short version: both are good — they just live at different layers.

* **OpenAI tool calling** = how the model asks for a function (it returns `tool_calls` with `name` + `arguments`).
* **FastMCP** = a way to *host* real tools (functions) and call them over a transport (SSE).

The clean pattern is: **let the model decide when to call a tool (OpenAI tool-calling), and when it does, forward that call to your FastMCP server**, then feed the tool’s result back to the model.

Here’s a minimal, drop-in adapter that wires them together.

---

### 1) Define tools for the model (schema)

```python
# tools_schema.py
openai_tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Retrieve temperature for a city.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "city": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["city"]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "set_weather",
            "description": "Set temperature for a city.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "city": {"type": "string"},
                    "temp": {"type": "number"}
                },
                "required": ["city", "temp"]
            }
        }
    }
]
```

---

### 2) Bridge: OpenAI tool-calls → FastMCP client

```python
import asyncio
# openai_with_mcp.py
import json

from fastmcp import Client as MCPClient
from openai import OpenAI
from tools_schema import openai_tools

client = OpenAI()

# Simple async MCP caller
async def mcp_call(tool_name: str, args: dict, server_url: str):
    async with MCPClient(server_url) as mcp:
        return await mcp.call_tool(tool_name, args)

def chat_with_tools(messages, server_url="http://127.0.0.1:8765/sse", model="gpt-4o-mini"):
    # 1) Ask model; allow tools
    resp = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        tools=openai_tools,
        tool_choice="auto",
        temperature=0.1,
        max_tokens=500,
    )
    msg = resp.choices[0].message
    tool_calls = getattr(msg, "tool_calls", None)

    if not tool_calls:
        # Model answered directly
        return msg.content

    # 2) For each requested tool, call FastMCP and collect results
    tool_results_msgs = []
    for call in tool_calls:
        name = call.function.name
        args = json.loads(call.function.arguments or "{}")
        result = asyncio.run(mcp_call(name, args, server_url))
        tool_results_msgs.append({
            "role": "tool",
            "tool_call_id": call.id,
            "name": name,
            "content": json.dumps(result) if not isinstance(result, str) else result
        })

    # 3) Provide tool outputs back to the model to get final answer
    followup = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages + [msg] + tool_results_msgs,
        temperature=0.1,
        max_tokens=500,
    )
    return followup.choices[0].message.content
```

**How it works**

* First call: model may return `tool_calls`.
* We forward each `tool_call` to your **FastMCP** server (`get_weather`, `set_weather`) and wrap the outputs as `"role": "tool"` messages (must include the original `tool_call_id`).
* Second call: model sees the tool outputs and produces the final answer.

---

### 3) Example usage

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Set Berlin to 18.5°C, then tell me Berlin’s temperature."}
    ]
    answer = chat_with_tools(messages)
    print(answer)
```

---

### Notes / gotchas

* In **OpenAI responses**, `tool_calls[i].function.arguments` is a JSON **string** — parse it.
* In the **tool reply message**, include:

  * `role="tool"`
  * `tool_call_id` (matching the assistant’s request)
  * `name` (function name)
  * `content` (string; `json.dumps` if you have structured data)
* Your earlier snippet that put `"system"` as a top-level argument caused the error; use a **system message** inside `messages` instead.
* If you later add more tools (e.g., `lookup_pubmed`), just add their JSON schema and implement them on your MCP server — the adapter stays the same.

This gives you the best of both worlds: **model-driven tool selection** + **a clean tool runtime (FastMCP)** you can reuse across services.



Great progress. Here’s the straight answer and a clean way to wire this up without overcomplicating it.

## TL;DR

* **Pick FastMCP + OpenAI function calling.** Skip LangChain for now. You already have a custom ES+Qdrant hybrid; LangChain would duplicate it.
* **FastMCP does not “decide” which tool to use.** It just **exposes** tools. The **LLM** chooses a tool via function calling (because you pass the tool schemas to OpenAI). Your client then executes the chosen tool via the MCP client and returns the result to the LLM.
* **Don’t hardcode `openai_tools`.** You can **discover** MCP tools and **convert** their schemas to OpenAI function format (you already wrote `convert_mcp_tool_to_function_format`). Use that.

---

## Fixes to your current server snippet

Right now you have a couple of bugs:

* You call `wait_for_es(ES, …)` but **ES is commented out**.
* You call `_hybrid` but you imported `hybrid_search` as `hybrid_search`. Use a consistent name.

Drop-in server (`tools_server.py`) using stdio (no ports):

```python
import os
from typing import Any, Dict, List

from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from fastmcp import FastMCP

from app.search.es_search import wait_for_es
from app.search.hybrid_search import hybrid_search as run_hybrid

mcp = FastMCP("MedicalTools")

ES_URL = os.getenv("ES_URL", "http://elasticsearch:9200")
ES = Elasticsearch(ES_URL, request_timeout=30)

@mcp.tool
def hybrid_search(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Retrieve top documents from ES+Qdrant hybrid retriever."""
    wait_for_es(ES, timeout=30)
    hits = run_hybrid(query, top_k=top_k)
    return [
        {
            "id": h.id,
            "title": h.title,
            "text": h.text,
            "score": getattr(h, "rrf_score", 0.0),
            "source_type": getattr(h, "source_type", None),
        }
        for h in hits
    ]

@mcp.tool
def search_wikipedia(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """(Stub) Retrieve context/definitions from Wikipedia."""
    return []

@mcp.tool
def simple_response_ok(query: str) -> str:
    """Signal: answer directly without retrieval."""
    return "OK"

@mcp.tool
def end_chat() -> str:
    """Signal: end the chat."""
    return "END"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # stdio server, no ports
```

---

## How the decision actually happens

* **FastMCP**: exposes tools (list/call). It doesn’t rank, index, or auto-route.
* **OpenAI function calling**: you give the model a **list of tools (schemas)**; the model decides which to call based on your **system prompt + user message**.
* **Your client**: when the model asks to call `hybrid_search`, your code invokes the MCP client to execute it, then sends the **tool result back to the model** to produce the final answer.

That’s it. No hidden indexing or “minimum searching” inside FastMCP.

> The line `result = mcp.run(query, available_tools=...)` is **not** how you should do tool routing with OpenAI. Use OpenAI’s function calling. FastMCP’s job is to **serve** tools; OpenAI’s job is to **choose** them.

---

## Don’t hand-write `openai_tools`

You already have utilities:

* `mcp_client.get_tools()` → returns MCP tool list
* `convert_mcp_tool_to_function_format(tool)` → convert each to OpenAI function schema

So:

```python
mcp_tools = mcp_client.get_tools()
openai_tools = convert_tools_list(mcp_tools)  # list of {"type":"function", ...}
```

No need to duplicate.

---

## Where do tools fit in your flow?

Don’t try to jam tool choice into `build_rag_prompt`. Tool use happens **before** you build a final prompt. The standard two-pass loop:

1. **First call** (model decides tool):

   * messages = \[system, user]
   * tools = `openai_tools` (converted from MCP)
   * call OpenAI; if it returns `tool_calls`, execute them via MCP client.
2. **Second call** (final answer):

   * append tool output as a `tool` message
   * call OpenAI again (same tools list is fine)
   * return final text to user

Minimal controller sketch (inside your ChatAssistant or a new path):

```python
def answer_with_tools(self, user_text: str):
    system_msg = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": (
            "You are a medical assistant.\n"
            "Tools:\n"
            "- hybrid_search: use for medical/scientific questions needing citations.\n"
            "- search_wikipedia: use if hybrid_search lacks coverage or a definition is needed.\n"
            "- simple_response_ok: use for non-medical/casual queries; answer directly.\n"
            "- end_chat: end the conversation.\n"
            "Return concise answers. Show sources only if retrieval produced documents."
        )
    }
    messages = [system_msg, {"role":"user","content":user_text}]
    tools = openai_tools  # from MCP discovery + conversion

    # 1) Let model choose tools
    r1 = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  # your model
        messages=messages,
        tools=tools,
        tool_choice="auto",
    )
    m = r1.choices[0].message
    messages.append({"role":"assistant","content":m.content or "", "tool_calls":m.tool_calls})

    # 2) Execute tool calls (if any)
    if m.tool_calls:
        for call in m.tool_calls:
            name = call.function.name
            args = json.loads(call.function.arguments or "{}")
            tool_result = mcp_client.call_tool(name, args)  # your MCP client
            # Make the tool output available to the model
            messages.append({
                "role": "tool",
                "tool_call_id": call.id,
                "name": name,
                "content": json.dumps(tool_result),
            })

        # 3) Final response after tools
        r2 = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=messages,
            tools=tools,  # keep so it can chain tools if needed
        )
        return r2.choices[0].message.content

    # If no tool chosen, just answer directly
    return m.content
```

### Why this is better than forcing `build_rag_prompt` early

* The tool results arrive as **messages**. The model already sees the retrieved text; you don’t need to rewrap it into a manual prompt. (You *can* still format for style, but it’s optional.)
* Your prior `build_rag_prompt` stays useful if you want to control how context is summarized, but it’s not required for tool calling.

---

## Start small: two tools + optional end-chat

* `hybrid_search`: returns list of docs (id/title/text/score/source\_type)
* `simple_response_ok`: tells the model “don’t retrieve; just answer”
* `end_chat`: lets the model gracefully end

Add `search_wikipedia` later.

---

## Optional: a tiny rule-based pre-router

You can still do a **cheap** pre-check before calling OpenAI to avoid tool spam:

* If the query is obviously non-medical (e.g., contains “president”, “NBA”), call the model **without** tools (or let it call `simple_response_ok`).
* Else call with tools and let it choose.

This is a nice latency saver, not required.

---

## Summary answers to your specific questions

* **Is LangChain only for ES?** No. It supports Qdrant and others—but you don’t need it right now.
* **Does FastMCP decide which tool to run?** No. It just exposes tools. The **LLM chooses** via function calling; your client executes them.
* **Do I need to pass tools to OpenAI if I use FastMCP?** Yes. You must pass the **tool schemas** (converted from MCP) to OpenAI so the model can decide. FastMCP ≠ router.
* **Should I hardcode `openai_tools`?** Prefer **dynamic**: discover MCP tools → convert → pass to OpenAI.
* **Should tool choice live inside `build_rag_prompt`?** No. Do tool choice via function calling **before** crafting any custom prompt; then add the tool outputs as messages for the final answer.

If you want, I can help you drop this into your `ChatAssistant.process_message` as a new branch like `use_tools=True` and keep your current non-tool flow as a fallback.

Yes, absolutely! That
's a much more sophisticated approach than simple tool calling. You'
re
implementing
an ** agent
pattern ** where
the
LLM
can:

1. ** Reason ** about
what
information
it
needs
2. ** Plan ** a
sequence
of
actions
3. ** Execute ** searches
iteratively
4. ** Reflect ** on
results and decide
next
steps

## Adapting This Pattern for Your Medical Assistant

Here
's how you could modify this for your MCP tools:

```python


def medical_agent_loop(question: str, max_iterations: int = 3):
    search_queries = []
    search_results = []
    conversation_context = []
    previous_actions = []
    iteration = 0

    while iteration < max_iterations:
        print(f'ITERATION #{iteration}...')

        # Build context from all accumulated results
        context = build_medical_context(search_results, conversation_context)

        prompt = medical_agent_prompt.format(
            question=question,
            context=context,
            search_queries="\n".join(search_queries),
            previous_actions='\n'.join([json.dumps(a) for a in previous_actions]),
            iteration_number=iteration,
            max_iterations=max_iterations
        )

        # Get LLM decision about next action
        response = llm(prompt)
        action_plan = json.loads(response)

        previous_actions.append(action_plan)
        action = action_plan['action']

        if action == 'MEDICAL_SEARCH':
            # Use your hybrid_search tool
            keywords = action_plan['keywords']
            search_queries.extend(keywords)

            for keyword in keywords:
                results = await mcp_client.call_tool("hybrid_search", {
                    "query": keyword,
                    "top_k": action_plan.get('top_k', 5)
                })
                search_results.extend(results)

        elif action == 'CONVERSATION_SEARCH':
            # Use your conversation history tool
            context_query = action_plan['context_query']
            conv_results = await mcp_client.call_tool("search_conversation_history", {
                "query": context_query
            })
            conversation_context.extend(conv_results)

        elif action == 'FINAL_ANSWER':
            # LLM has enough info to answer
            return action_plan['answer']

        elif action == 'CLARIFICATION_NEEDED':
            # Ask user for more specifics
            return action_plan['clarification_request']

        # Deduplicate and prepare for next iteration
        search_results = dedup(search_results)
        iteration += 1

    # Fallback if max iterations reached
    return "I need more information to provide a complete answer."


```

## Enhanced Prompt Template

```python
medical_agent_prompt = """
You are a medical research assistant. Your goal is to answer: {question}

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- MEDICAL_SEARCH: Search medical literature/knowledge base
- CONVERSATION_SEARCH: Search previous conversation context
- FINAL_ANSWER: Provide complete answer with sources
- CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: Ask user for more specific information

CURRENT CONTEXT:
{context}

PREVIOUS SEARCHES: {search_queries}
PREVIOUS ACTIONS: {previous_actions}

ITERATION: {iteration_number}/{max_iterations}

Respond with JSON in this format:
{{
    "reasoning": "Why you chose this action",
    "action": "MEDICAL_SEARCH|CONVERSATION_SEARCH|FINAL_ANSWER|CLARIFICATION_NEEDED",
    "keywords": ["search", "terms"] // if MEDICAL_SEARCH
    "context_query": "search terms" // if CONVERSATION_SEARCH
    "answer": "detailed response with citations" // if FINAL_ANSWER
    "clarification_request": "what you need to know" // if CLARIFICATION_NEEDED
    "confidence": 0.8 // how confident you are (0-1)
}}
"""
```

## Why This Is Better Than Simple Tool Calling

** Simple

- User

tool → Done

** Agent

- User

- LLM

- Realizes
it
needs

- Searches

- Finds

- Synthesizes

## Example Flow

```
User: "How does this new medication interact with what we discussed before?"

Iteration
0:
- Action: CONVERSATION_SEARCH
- Reasoning: "Need to find previous medication discussion"

Iteration
1:
- Action: MEDICAL_SEARCH
- Keywords: ["drug_name", "interactions", "contraindications"]
- Reasoning: "Found previous drug, now need interaction data"

Iteration
2:
