#This directory should contain reusable, production-ready ingestion modules that your main application uses:

#  src/ingestion/
#  ├── __init__.py
#  ├── data_processor.py      # Clean, validate, transform medical data
#  ├── embedding_generator.py # Generate embeddings (reusable across services)
#  ├── es_client.py          # Elasticsearch connection & operations
#  ├── qdrant_client.py      # Qdrant connection & operations
#  ├── batch_processor.py    # Handle large data batches efficiently
#  └── pipeline_orchestrator.py # Coordinate multi-step ingestion

#  Key Differences

#  Scripts (setup/maintenance):
#  - Run manually or via cron
#  - One-time data population
#  - Quick and dirty is OK
#  - Direct execution (python script.py)

#  Src/ingestion (production code):
#  - Imported by your main application
#  - Reusable classes and functions
#  - Proper error handling, logging
#  - Used by your search API, evaluation scripts, monitoring

#  Your Development Plan Alignment

#  Based on your plan, you'll need src/ingestion/ components when you build:
#  - Day 1: Search implementations that need to query these services
#  - Day 2: Evaluation scripts that need consistent data access
#  - Day 3: Streamlit app that imports these modules
#  - Later: Any data refresh or incremental updates

#  Start with scripts for now (keeps momentum), then refactor shared logic into src/ingestion/ when you build the search
#  implementations.


#Yes, exactly! After you finish the Qdrant ingestion, you should move straight into the Triple Search Implementation to stay on
#  Day 1 schedule.

#  Next Steps (Afternoon 1-5pm):

#  1. Create the Search Methods

#  src/search/
#  ├── qdrant_search.py    # Method 1: Pure Qdrant (PRIMARY)
#  ├── text_search.py      # Method 2: ES BM25
#  └── hybrid_search.py    # Method 3: Qdrant+ES Hybrid

#  Each should have a simple function like:
#  def search(query: str, limit: int = 5) -> list:
#      # Return list of relevant documents

#  2. Simple RAG Pipeline (Evening 6-9pm)

#  Create a basic RAG that:
#  - Takes a medical question
#  - Uses one of your search methods to find relevant docs
#  - Sends question + context to OpenAI
#  - Returns generated answer

#  src/llm/
#  ├── openai_client.py    # OpenAI connection
#  └── rag_pipeline.py     # search → context → LLM → answer

#  3. Test Everything Together

#  Create a simple test script that asks the same medical question to all 3 search methods and shows the different results.

#  Why This Order Makes Sense:

#  - Search first = You can test retrieval quality immediately
#  - RAG second = You can compare how different search methods affect final answers
#  - Sets up Day 2 = You'll have working components to evaluate tomorrow

#  The key is getting working end-to-end functionality today, even if it's basic. Polish comes later!

#  Focus on: Does it work? Can I get different results from the 3 methods? Can I generate answers?

#docker compose down -v
#rm -rf ./esdata ./qdrant_storage
#docker compose up -d




#Short answer: your plan is totally realistic. On-demand Wikipedia is how lots of production RAG systems handle “long tail” facts without bloating the index. With local embeddings (MiniLM) it’s fast enough if you chunk sensibly and cache.

#What the latency looks like (typical)

#Fetch wiki page (REST API): 100–500 ms

#Parse & chunk (e.g., 500–800 tokens, 20–40% overlap): ~50–150 ms

#Embed chunks locally (MiniLM on CPU, 20–80 chunks): 0.5–2.5 s

#Upsert to Qdrant (+ ES doc + vector): < 0.5 s

#Re-run retrieval: < 200 ms

#End-to-end: usually 1.5–4 s for a big page; often less for smaller pages. That’s interactive.

#Make it robust (simple rules)

#Chunk before embedding (don’t embed full pages).

#Cache: keep a tiny KV (e.g., SQLite or Redis) from title → {chunks, doc_ids, timestamp}.
#Reuse if asked again within, say, 7 days.

#ID scheme: wikipedia:<slug>#c0001 … so upserts are idempotent and Hybrid works (same IDs in ES and in Qdrant payloads).

#Guardrail: only enrich when needed, e.g. if top1_qdrant_score < 0.45 or no hits from ES.

#Minimal enrich flow (pseudocode you can drop in)
#def maybe_enrich_with_wikipedia(query, qdrant_hits, es_hits):
#    need = (not qdrant_hits) or (qdrant_hits[0].score < 0.45) or (not es_hits)
#    if not need:
#        return False, []
    # 1) fetch text (lead + 2–3 sections)
#    title, text = fetch_wiki_best_match(query)  # use Wikipedia search API
#    if not text: return False, []
    # 2) chunk
#    chunks = chunk_text(title, text, max_tokens=700, overlap=120)
    # 3) build docs with consistent IDs
#    docs = [
#        {
#          "id": f"wikipedia:{slug(title)}#c{ix:04d}",
#          "source_type": "wikipedia",
#          "title": title,
#          "text": chunk_text,
#          "wiki_id": "", "source": "wikipedia_live", "url": wiki_url(title)
#        }
#        for ix, chunk_text in enumerate(chunks)
#    ]
    # 4) upsert to Qdrant + index to ES (compute same MiniLM embeddings)
#    upsert_qdrant_batch(docs)   # vector=MiniLM(title+"\n\n"+text)
#    index_es_batch(docs)        # doc + text_vector field
#    return True, [d["id"] for d in docs]


#(You already have upsert_qdrant/index_es patterns; just reuse them here.)

#When you might feel it’s “too slow”

#Very long pages (hundreds of KB). Fix: limit to lead + first N sections or top 10 sections by TF-IDF relevance to the query before embedding.

#Many enriches back-to-back. Fix: cache and rate-limit (Wikipedia asks for polite usage + a User-Agent string).

#Underpowered machines. Fix: lower chunk size / count, or embed asynchronously while returning a first answer, then re-rank on the next turn. (For your course demo, synchronous is fine.)

#Is dropping Wikipedia now OK?

#Yes. Start with textbook + PubMed (best signal), evaluate, and add on-demand wiki only when your retrieval confidence is low. That keeps your index small and focused, and you still cover gaps.

#Tiny to-do list to wire this up

# Add chunk_text() (simple token/sentence splitter with overlap).

# Add fetch_wiki_best_match(query) (Wikipedia search → pick top title → get plaintext).

# Implement maybe_enrich_with_wikipedia() decision rule.

# Cache results (SQLite file is enough).

# Log metrics: wiki_fetch_count, wiki_enrich_latency_seconds, wiki_cache_hit_ratio.

#If you want, I can give you a compact fetch_wiki_best_match() + chunk_text() you can paste into your app right now.9
